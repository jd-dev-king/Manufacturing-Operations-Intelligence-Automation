# Manufacturing Operations Intelligence Automation

## Version 2.0.0

An automated manufacturing analytics platform that transforms production data into actionable operational insights through ETL processing, KPI calculations, dashboards, automated reporting, and email delivery.

This project evolved from the original **Daily Report Mailer (v1.0.0)** sales reporting automation system into a manufacturing-focused intelligence platform designed to simulate real-world production performance monitoring.

---

# Project Overview

Manufacturing organizations rely on accurate production data to monitor efficiency, identify losses, and drive continuous improvement.

The **Manufacturing Operations Intelligence Automation** platform automates the process of:

1. Loading production data
2. Cleaning and preparing manufacturing records
3. Calculating key operational metrics
4. Generating manufacturing performance charts
5. Exporting dashboard-ready data
6. Creating automated reports
7. Delivering reports through email automation

The result is an end-to-end analytics workflow similar to systems used in manufacturing operations environments.

# Key Features

## Manufacturing KPI Engine

The pipeline calculates critical manufacturing performance indicators including:

* Production output
* Reject quantities
* Yield percentage
* Scrap percentage
* Downtime analysis
* Availability
* Performance
* Quality
* Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

---

## Automated Data Pipeline

The workflow follows a structured ETL architecture:

```
Production Data (CSV)
          |
          v
Data Loading
          |
          v
Data Cleaning
          |
          v
Manufacturing KPI Calculations
          |
          v
Chart Generation
          |
          v

# Manufacturing Metrics

## Yield Performance

Measures the percentage of acceptable production output:

```
Yield % =
(Produced Units - Rejected Units)
/
Produced Units
× 100
```

---

## Scrap Monitoring

Tracks production losses caused by rejected units:

```
Scrap % =
Rejected Units
/
Produced Units
× 100
```

---

## Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

Evaluates manufacturing efficiency using:

```
OEE =
Availability × Performance × Quality
```

OEE provides insight into equipment utilization and production effectiveness.
